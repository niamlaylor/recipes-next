## **Sifter** is a recipe parser designed to save you time when browsing online recipes - by cutting out all the extra stuff, and giving you _just_ the recipe.

No profound stories, no ads, no pop-ups. (Maybe - cookies.)

Enter the URL of a great recipe, and we'll send it back with what you need - so you can spend less time scrolling, and more time saut√©eing.
